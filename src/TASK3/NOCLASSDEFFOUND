NOCLASSDEFFOUND is an error not an exception which is generate at runtime when a .class is missing at runtime but compiler make it
But it is not available at run time...
Example Let there are two classes A and B and we compile these classes and compiler generate these two classes in .class form
and I delete that file from the folder through manually or through command then at the runtime when interpreter try to find that file
but it is not available at that time because we have already delete it from the folder that's why it generate error(NOCLASSDEFFOUND)
